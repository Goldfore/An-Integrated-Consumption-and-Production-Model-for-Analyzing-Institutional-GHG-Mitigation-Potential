An Integrated Consumption and Production Model for Analyzing Institutional GHG Mitigation Potential

This repository contains an integrated model for analyzing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential by combining consumption and production models.
The repository contains two folders, one for the consumption model and one for the production model.

Production Model
The production model is written in MATLAB and includes the following files and folders:

- ProductionModel.m: the main MATLAB script that runs the production model.
- functions: a folder containing auxiliary functions for the model.
- raw_data: a folder containing the data for the model.
- Read Me.docx: lists the required files to make the production model accessible to another institution.

Consumption Model
The consumption model is written in Python and includes the following files and folders:

- Appliances Algorithm: a folder containing algorithm for data preprocessing related to appliances.
- Cooling Algorithm: a folder containing algorithm for data preprocessing related to cooling consumption.
- Models: a folder containing the consumption model, related data, data analysis, and graphs.
- requirements.txt: lists the required packages to run the consumption model.

How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt for the consumption model.
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the production model folder.
- Run the ProductionModel.m script.
- The output from the production model will be saved to a file.
- Open the consumption model folder and run the Python script to analyze the output from the production model.
